    A very simple and straightforward implementation of a trie for demonstration purposes

    A serious real-world implementation of a trie or an automaton would not be implemented

    and there'd be significant attention on memory consumption and scalability with respect to
    dictionary size.

    A node in the trie is also a trie itself in this implementation.
