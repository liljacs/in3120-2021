# Assignment D

**Deadline:** 2021-10-29 

The purpose of this assignment is twofold:

* Implement a better ranker than the `BrainDeadRanker` class. For example, inverse document frequency (i.e., considering how frequent the query terms are across the corpus) and static rank (i.e., a query-independent quality score per document) are two factors that you should include.
* Realize a simple search engine that is capable of approximate matching, e.g., where the query _organik kemmistry_ matches documents containing the terms _organic chemistry_. We will do this by using a tokenizer that produces _k_-grams (i.e., overlapping "shingles" of width _k_) and combine this with _n_-of-_m_ matching. For example, for _k_ = 3, the string _banana_ would be tokenized into the shingles {_ban_, _ana_, _nan_, _ana_}.

Your solution should only contain edits to the files `shinglegenerator.py` and `betterranker.py`. Changes to other files will be ignored.

Implementation notes:

* The `BetterRanker` class implements a better ranker than the `BrainDeadRanker` class.
* You are not required to compute a static rank score _g(d)_ for each document _d_, but can for the sake of simplicity assume that this value is stored in a suitably named document field. If the named field is missing or doesn't have a value, a default static rank score of 0.0 can be assumed.
* The `ShingleGenerator` class implements a tokenizer that produces shingles.

Your task is to:

* Familiarize yourself with the precode.
* Implement the missing code in the `BetterRanker` class.
* Implement the missing code in the `ShingleGenerator` class.
* Ensure that the code is correct and passes all tests.

Some optional bonus challenges for the interested student:

* Extend your `ShingleGenerator` implementation to make special provisions for the beginning and/or ending of strings, so that these are given more weight than other parts of the words. For example, _banana_ could be processed as _^banana$_ where the special marker symbols _^_ and _$_ are added as padding. Do you think this makes a difference?
* When working with shingles, the Jaccard distance between the set of shingles in the query and the set of shingles in the document is sometimes used as a relevancy measure. Write a ranker that implements this.
* Extend your ranker to additionally post-process all matches so that edit distance influences the ranking.
* Extend the `BrainDeadNormalizer` class to do naÃ¯ve stemming (e.g., for terms longer than _n_ characters we only keep the first _n_ characters) or other types of linguistically motivated transformations. Do you think this makes a difference when combined with standard tokenization as performed by the `BrainDeadTokenizer` class?
